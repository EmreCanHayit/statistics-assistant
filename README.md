# Simple Random Sample
### What is a simple random sample ?
A simple random sample is a subset of a statistical population in which each member of the subset has an equal probability of being chosen. A simple random sample is meant to be an unbiased representation of a group.
Random sampling is used in science to conduct randomized control tests or for blinded experiments.

# Systematic Random Sampling
### What is a systematic random sampling ?
Systematic sampling is a type of probability sampling method in which sample members from a larger population are selected according to a random starting point but with a fixed, periodic interval.

# Frequency Series
### What is a frequency series ?
A frequency distribution is a representation, either in a graphical or tabular format, that displays the number of observations within a given interval.

# Frequency Table
### What is a frequency table ?
A frequency table shows the distribution of observations based on the options in a variable. Frequency tables are helpful to understand which options occur more or less often in the dataset.

# Central Tendency Standard
### What is a central tendecy standard ?
A measure of central tendency is a single value that attempts to describe a set of data by identifying the central position within that set of data.

# Distribution Standard
### What is a distribution standard
he normal distribution is a probability function that describes how the values of a variable are distributed. It is a symmetric distribution where most of the observations cluster around the central peak and the probabilities for values further away from the mean taper off equally in both directions.
### Calculations
* Sample variance
* Standard deviation
* Average absolute deviation
* Interquartile range (q1, q3)
* Skewness
* Kurtosis
* Coefficient of variation
